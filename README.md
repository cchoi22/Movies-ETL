# Movies-ETL
## 1. Overview:
The purpose of this exercise is to follow the ETL process for film data obtained through Kaggle. Raw data was provided and extracted through Kaggle and the data was then cleaned and trimmed. Three sets of data were utilized in the example, Wiki.json, Ratings.csv and Movie_Metadata.csv. Each raw dataset was cleaned of empty or repeated rows. Catigories such as TV shows were removed because the only interested was movie data. The post-processed data was then loaded onto an SQL database and queried to confirm the load procedure was correct.
